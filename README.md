# 🌾 Crop Production Data Analysis Dashboard

This project is a frontend application built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Mantine UI**, and **Apache ECharts** to visualize agricultural crop production data. It provides insights into the crops with **maximum and minimum production by year** and also displays a **bar chart** showing the **average production per crop**.


## ✨ Features

- 📅 **Table View**: Displays crops with the highest and lowest production each year.
- 📊 **Bar Chart**: Aggregates and shows average crop production by crop name.
- 🌗 **Dark/Light UI Toggle**: Easily switch between dark and light modes with a single click.
- 🔁 **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes.
- ⚙️ **Pure Apache ECharts** (not React wrappers).
